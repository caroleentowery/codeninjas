# Declares the starting point for threes

# Creates an array with multiples of three
wholeArray = Array.new [threes]
while threes < 1000

# Creates an array with multiples of five

# Nice job Caroleen.  Good use of the built in Ruby functions.
#
# Is there a way you could solve the problem with just one looping over the numbers?

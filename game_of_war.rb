# What you want to do here is leverage methods.  By putting the 'skirmish' portion of this loop in a method
# including the part of it that determines the winner, you will be able to call that skirmish method at the end
# of a battle.
#
# So, it would look like this:
# 
# Skirmish Method (Called within the overall game loop)
#     Inside skirmish method the following happens
#        Deal a card from each player
#        Determine the outcome (one of three outcomes)
#            Outcome 1 - Player 1 wins, give player 1 the spoils
#            Outcome 2 - Player 2 wins, give player 2 the spoils
#            Outcome 3 - Battle, call a method that runs the battle (see below)
# End Skirmish Method
#
# Battle Method (Called with skirmish method has outcome 3
#     Inside battle method the following happens
#         Deal three cards from each player
#         Call Skirmish Method
# End Battle Method
#
# See how the methods call each other?
#
# You will also want to look into using methods from some of the other checks you make,
# such as determining the skirmish outcome and determining if a player has won.
# 
# Great job so far, keep it up.
